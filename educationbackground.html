        <h3>Education background </h3>
         <p>Education is the key to success as well.Therefore, I did 
           my form four exams in the year 2019 and joined KMTC to study clinical 
           officer.Therefore I decided to defer and join Moringa School as software developer
           inorder to acqire more knowledge and skills on how to solve problems 
           in our society using modern techonology through coding .I will then go back to finish my 
           clinical officer course by the end of core inorder to venture more in different skills.
