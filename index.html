           <h3>Education background </h3>
            <p>Education is the key to success as well.Therefore, I did 
              my form four exams in the year 2019 and joined KMTC to study clinical 
              officer.Therefore I decided to defer and join Moringa School as software developer
              inorder to acqire more knowledge and skills on how to solve problems 
              in our society using modern techonology through coding .I will then go back to finish my 
              clinical officer course by the end of core inorder to venture more in different skills.
