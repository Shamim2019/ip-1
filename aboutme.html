       <p>Am a soft ware developer having started to  acquire much knowledge about coding
       Am currently studying at Moringa school inorder to acquire
       more skills on how to code and become the best software in the world.
       Having no skills doesn't mean  that one isn't capable of learning and making changes
       therefore, am really hoping to go further .</p>
